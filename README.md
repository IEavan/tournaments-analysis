# Analysis of Tournament Structures
Does the best player always win a tournament? If not how likely is it that he will win?
What about your chances of coming in second if you are second best?

Many different tournament structures are likely to have different answers to these questions.
In this project I want to analyze the dynamics of tournaments under the assumption
that individual matches are inherently stochastic.
